# Obfuse

## A little script for obfuscating data

Make your files unreadable to non-tech savvy users! It will increment (obfuscate mode) or decrement (calrify mode) the values of all of the bytes in the given file(s).

Usage: `python obfuse.py <mode> [files/directories]`

`<mode>` can be `obfuscate` or `clarify`.

`[files/directories]` is a list of files or directories that you want to alter.
